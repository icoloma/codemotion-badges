A small experiment to generate the badges for speakers at Codemotion. To generate the list of badges, run the following:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
firefox http://localhost:8000
```

To print, in Firefox (does not work with Chrome) print to PDF by selecting a custom page of 3.34 by 2.16 inches (85 * 55cm) and enabling "print background".
